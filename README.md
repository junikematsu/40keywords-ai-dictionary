_A Human-Centered Dictionary for the Age of Artificial Intelligence_

---

## Overview

Imagine a world where AI has become ubiquitous, where decision-making processes operate as black boxes, and where transparency and trustworthiness have emerged as society's most critical challenges.

The AI era represents a fundamental transformation — not just in technology, but in how individuals work, how organizations function, and how society operates. This shift demands entirely new concepts, perspectives, and frameworks. Yet no comprehensive guide exists to navigate this emerging landscape.

This document anticipates the world several years into AI adoption. It proposes new perspectives and metrics essential for thriving in that future.
