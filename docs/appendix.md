# Appendix — 40 Keywords for 2030  
_The Vocabulary AI Can't Teach You_

---

## Overview

This appendix provides an easy-to-read summary of the **40 keywords**  
that make up the "AI Vocabulary for 2030" project — a human-centered dictionary  
designed to help people and organizations navigate the age of artificial intelligence.

Each keyword captures a **new mindset, metric, or design principle**  
that will define how humans and machines co-create meaning in the coming decade.

---

## Why It Matters

AI can calculate and optimize, but it still struggles to understand **context, nuance, and emotion**.  
The 40 keywords collected here highlight the dimensions of intelligence, trust,  
and creativity that remain uniquely human.

They are meant to be read, discussed, and remixed — not only by engineers and researchers,  
but also by educators, artists, entrepreneurs, and policy makers.
